/**
 * Provides the classes for version 1 of
 * the Adventure game.
 *
 * We're not using packages for our code, 
 * so I might just put a list of lessons learned
 * and challenges overcome here.
 * Of course, I would change the Project name for each project.
 * 
 * Including this file gets rid of a checkstyle error.
